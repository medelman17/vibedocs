## 1. Executive Summary

**Spellbook** is the market-leading legal AI contract tool, serving 4,000+ law firms and in-house teams across 80+ countries. Founded in 2018 as "Rally" and pivoted to generative AI in September 2022, Spellbook was the **first generative AI tool purpose-built for lawyers**.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Valuation** | $350M (October 2025) |
| **Total Funding** | $80M+ |
| **Customers** | 4,000+ legal teams |
| **Countries** | 80+ |
| **Contracts Reviewed** | 10M+ |
| **Revenue Growth** | 3x YoY (2025) |
| **Founded** | 2018 (as Rally) |
| **Headquarters** | St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada |

### Competitive Positioning

Spellbook positions itself as "the most complete legal AI suite for commercial lawyers" with a "Cursor for contracts" analogy. Their core differentiator is **deep Microsoft Word integration** combined with **preference learning** that adapts to each lawyer's style.

### Implications for VibeDocs

Spellbook is a formidable competitor with significant funding, market traction, and a comprehensive feature set. However, their focus on general commercial contracts (not NDA-specific), closed-source methodology, and premium pricing ($179+/user/month) creates opportunities for VibeDocs to differentiate through:

1. **NDA specialization** with evidence-based analysis
2. **Open-source transparency**
3. **Accessible pricing** (free tier + affordable plans)
4. **Cited evidence** from annotated legal datasets
