## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: AI SDK migration before extraction work (deprecated API risk)
- [Roadmap]: OCR as separate phase (adds complexity, research flagged)
- [Roadmap]: Pipeline orchestration after all agents (weaves them together)
- [01-01]: No garbled text detection - let downstream stages fail naturally
- [01-01]: Validation gates are infrastructure only - Plan 03 integrates into pipeline

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Phase 10 (SSE) may need Inngest Realtime vs custom SSE evaluation
- [Research]: Phase 7 (Risk Scoring) citation verification patterns need validation
